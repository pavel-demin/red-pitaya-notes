Hardware
-----

The SDR transceiver consists of two SDR receivers and of two SDR transmitters.

The implementation of the SDR receivers is quite straightforward:

 - An antenna is connected to one of the high-impedance analog inputs.
 - The on-board ADC (122.88 MS/s sampling frequency, 16-bit resolution) digitizes the RF signal from the antenna.
 - The data coming from the ADC is processed by a in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) digital down-converter (DDC) running on the Red Pitaya's FPGA.

The SDR transmitters consist of the similar blocks but arranged in an opposite order:

 - The I/Q data is processed by a digital up-converter (DUC) running on the Red Pitaya's FPGA.
 - The on-board DAC (122.88 MS/s sampling frequency, 14-bit resolution) outputs RF signal.
 - An antenna is connected to one of the analog outputs.

The tunable frequency range covers from 0 Hz to 60 MHz.

The I/Q data rate is configurable and five settings are available: 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 768 and 1536 kSPS.

The basic blocks of the digital down-converters (DDC) and of the digital up-converters (DUC) are shown in the following diagram:

The [projects/sdr_transceiver_122_88](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/sdr_transceiver_122_88) directory contains four Tcl files: [block_design.tcl](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/sdr_transceiver_122_88/block_design.tcl), [trx.tcl](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/sdr_transceiver_122_88/trx.tcl), [rx.tcl](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/sdr_transceiver_122_88/rx.tcl), [tx.tcl](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/sdr_transceiver_122_88/tx.tcl). The code in these files instantiates, configures and interconnects all the needed IP cores.

Software
-----

The [projects/sdr_transceiver_122_88/server](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/sdr_transceiver_122_88/server) directory contains the source code of the TCP server ([sdr-transceiver.c](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/sdr_transceiver_122_88/server/sdr-transceiver.c)) that receives control commands and transmits/receives the I/Q data streams (up to 2 x 32 bit x 1536 kSPS = 91.6 Mbit/s) to/from the SDR programs.

The [projects/sdr_transceiver/extio](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/sdr_transceiver/extio) directory contains the source code of the ExtIO plug-in.

The [projects/sdr_transceiver_122_88/gnuradio](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/sdr_transceiver_122_88/gnuradio) directory contains [GNU Radio](https://gnuradio.org) blocks and a few flow graph configurations for [GNU Radio Companion](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/GNURadioCompanion).

Getting started with GNU Radio
-----

 - Connect an antenna to the IN1 connector on the Red Pitaya board.
 - Download [SD card image zip file]({{ site.release-image }}) (more details about the SD card image can be found at [this link]({{ "/alpine/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})).
 - Copy the contents of the SD card image zip file to a micro SD card.
 - Optionally, to start the application automatically at boot time, copy its `start.sh` file from `apps/sdr_transceiver_122_88` to the topmost directory on the SD card.
 - Install the micro SD card in the Red Pitaya board and connect the power.
 - Install [GNU Radio](https://gnuradio.org):
{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install gnuradio
{% endhighlight %}
 - Clone the source code repository:
{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes
{% endhighlight %}
 - Run [GNU Radio Companion](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/GNURadioCompanion) and open AM transceiver flow graph:
{% highlight bash %}
cd red-pitaya-notes/projects/sdr_transceiver_122_88/gnuradio
export GRC_BLOCKS_PATH=.
gnuradio-companion trx_am.grc
{% endhighlight %}

Getting started with SDR# and HDSDR
-----

 - Connect an antenna to the IN1 connector on the Red Pitaya board.
 - Download [SD card image zip file]({{ site.release-image }}) (more details about the SD card image can be found at [this link]({{ "/alpine/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})).
 - Copy the contents of the SD card image zip file to a micro SD card.
 - Optionally, to start the application automatically at boot time, copy its `start.sh` file from `apps/sdr_transceiver_122_88` to the topmost directory on the SD card.
 - Install the micro SD card in the Red Pitaya board and connect the power.
 - Download and install [SDR#](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5fy49wae6xwxa8a/AAAdAcU238cppWziK4xPRIADa/sdr/sdrsharp_v1.0.0.1361_with_plugins.zip?dl=1) or [HDSDR](https://www.hdsdr.de).
 - Download [pre-built ExtIO plug-in]({{ site.extio-file }}) for SDR# and HDSDR.
 - Copy `extio_red_pitaya.dll` into the SDR# or HDSDR installation directory.
 - Start SDR# or HDSDR.
 - Select Red Pitaya from the Source list in SDR# or from the Options [F7] &rarr; Select Input menu in HDSDR.
 - Press Configure icon in SDR# or press SDR-Device [F8] button in HDSDR, then enter the IP address of the Red Pitaya board and set ADC sample rate to 122.88 MSPS.
 - Press Play icon in SDR# or press Start [F2] button in HDSDR.
