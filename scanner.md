Introduction
-----

This configuration may be useful for building a galvanometer controller for an optical scanner or a scanning coil controller for a scanning electron microscope.

Interesting links
-----

Some interesting links on scanning and imaging techniques:

 - [Scanning and Image Reconstruction Techniques in Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/15823)

 - [Spectral Imaging: Active hyperspectral sensing and imaging for remote spectroscopy applications](https://www.laserfocusworld.com/test-measurement/spectroscopy/article/16556842/spectral-imaging-active-hyperspectral-sensing-and-imaging-for-remote-spectroscopy-applications)

Hardware
-----

The system outputs the line scan signal to OUT1 and the raster scan signal to OUT2. The trigger and S&H pulses are available from the pins DIO0_N and DIO1_N on the E1 connector. The analog signals corresponding to each pixel are input to IN1 and IN2.

The basic blocks of the system are shown in the following diagram:

The [projects/scanner](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/scanner) directory contains one Tcl file [block_design.tcl](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/scanner/block_design.tcl) that instantiates, configures and interconnects all the needed IP cores.

Software
-----

The [projects/scanner/server](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/scanner/server) directory contains the source code of the TCP server ([scanner.c](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/scanner/server/scanner.c)) that receives control commands and transmits the data to the control program running on a remote PC.

The [projects/scanner/client](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/scanner/client) directory contains the source code of the control program ([scanner.py](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/scanner/client/scanner.py)).

Getting started with GNU/Linux
-----

 - Download customized [SD card image zip file]({{ site.scanner-image }}).
 - Copy the contents of the SD card image zip file to a micro SD card.
 - Install the micro SD card in the Red Pitaya board and connect the power.
 - Install required Python libraries:
{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-matplotlib python3-pyqt5
{% endhighlight %}
 - Clone the source code repository:
{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes
{% endhighlight %}
 - Run the control program:
{% highlight bash %}
cd red-pitaya-notes/projects/scanner/client
python3 scanner.py
{% endhighlight %}
 - Type in the IP address of the Red Pitaya board and press Connect button.
 - Adjust trigger and S&H pulses and number of samples per pixel.
 - Press Scan button.

Building from source
-----

The installation of the development machine is described at [this link]({{ "/development-machine/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

The structure of the source code and of the development chain is described at [this link]({{ "/led-blinker/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

Setting up the Vitis and Vivado environment:
{% highlight bash %}
source /opt/Xilinx/Vitis/2023.1/settings64.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Cloning the source code repository:
{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes
cd red-pitaya-notes
{% endhighlight %}

Building `scanner.bit`:
{% highlight bash %}
make NAME=scanner bit
{% endhighlight %}

Building SD card image zip file:
{% highlight bash %}
source helpers/build-project.sh scanner
{% endhighlight %}
