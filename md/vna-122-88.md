## Hardware

The basic blocks of the system are shown in the following diagram:

![Vector Network Analyzer](/img/vna-122-88.png)

The [projects/vna_122_88]($source$/projects/vna_122_88) directory contains one Tcl file [block_design.tcl]($source$/projects/vna_122_88/block_design.tcl) that instantiates, configures and interconnects all the needed IP cores.

## Software

The [projects/vna_122_88/server]($source$/projects/vna_122_88/server) directory contains the source code of the TCP server ([vna.c]($source$/projects/vna_122_88/server/vna.c)) that receives control commands and transmits the data to the control program running on a remote PC.

The [projects/vna/client]($source$/projects/vna/client) directory contains the source code of the control program ([vna.py]($source$/projects/vna/client/vna.py)).

## Getting started with MS Windows

- Download [SD card image zip file]($release_image$) (more details about the SD card image can be found at [this link](/alpine/)).
- Copy the contents of the SD card image zip file to a micro SD card.
- Optionally, to start the application automatically at boot time, copy its `start.sh` file from `apps/vna_122_88` to the topmost directory on the SD card.
- Install the micro SD card in the STEMlab SDR board and connect the power.
- Download and unpack the [release zip file]($release_file$).
- Run the `vna.exe` program in the `control` directory.
- Type in the IP address of the STEMlab SDR board and press Connect button.
- Perform calibration and measurements.

## Getting started with GNU/Linux

- Download [SD card image zip file]($release_image$) (more details about the SD card image can be found at [this link](/alpine/)).
- Copy the contents of the SD card image zip file to a micro SD card.
- Optionally, to start the application automatically at boot time, copy its `start.sh` file from `apps/vna_122_88` to the topmost directory on the SD card.
- Install the micro SD card in the STEMlab SDR board and connect the power.
- Install required Python libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-matplotlib python3-pyqt5
```

- Clone the source code repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes
```

- Run the control program:

```bash
cd red-pitaya-notes/projects/vna/client
python3 vna.py
```

- Type in the IP address of the STEMlab SDR board and press Connect button.
- Perform calibration and measurements.

## Building from source

The installation of the development machine is described at [this link](/development-machine/).

The structure of the source code and of the development chain is described at [this link](/led-blinker/).
