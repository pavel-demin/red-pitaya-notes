## Short description

The system consists of one in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) digital down-converter (DDC) and of one pulse generator.

The tunable frequency range covers from 0 Hz to 60 MHz.

The I/Q data rate is configurable and six settings are available: 25, 50, 125, 250, 500, 1250 kSPS.

## Hardware

The basic blocks of the system are shown in the following diagram:

![Pulsed NMR](/img/pulsed-nmr.png)

The [projects/pulsed_nmr]($source$/projects/pulsed_nmr) directory contains three Tcl files: [block_design.tcl]($source$/projects/pulsed_nmr/block_design.tcl), [rx.tcl]($source$/projects/pulsed_nmr/rx.tcl), [tx.tcl]($source$/projects/pulsed_nmr/tx.tcl). The code in these files instantiates, configures and interconnects all the needed IP cores.

The source code of the [R](https://www.r-project.org) script used to calculate the coefficients of the FIR filter can be found in [projects/pulsed_nmr/filters/fir_0.r]($source$/projects/pulsed_nmr/filters/fir_0.r).

## RF and GPIO connections

- two digital down-converters (DDC) are connected to IN1 and IN2
- pulse generator is connected to OUT1
- continuous cosine signal of the receiver's DDS is connected to OUT2
- digital output for RX/TX switch control is connected to pin DIO0_N of the [extension connector E1](https://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developerGuide/hardware/ORIG_GEN/125-14/top.html#extension-connector-e1)
- general purpose digital outputs are connected to the pins DIO0_P - DIO7_P of the [extension connector E1](https://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developerGuide/hardware/ORIG_GEN/125-14/top.html#extension-connector-e1)

## Software

The [projects/pulsed_nmr/server]($source$/projects/pulsed_nmr/server) directory contains the source code of the TCP server ([pulsed-nmr.c]($source$/projects/pulsed_nmr/server/pulsed-nmr.c)) that receives control commands and transmits the I/Q data streams (up to 4 x 32 bit x 1250 kSPS = 152 Mbit/s) to the control program running on a remote PC.

The [projects/pulsed_nmr/client]($source$/projects/pulsed_nmr/client) directory contains the source code of the control program ([pulsed_nmr.py]($source$/projects/pulsed_nmr/client/pulsed_nmr.py)).

## .NET library

The .NET library provides a minimalist set of commands for controlling all parameters of the signal processing modules and programming the pulse generator. The commands can be classified into five groups:

Commands to manage the connection with the TCP server:

- Connect(address)
- Disconnect()

Commands to set the frequencies and decimation rate:

- SetFreqRX(frequency)
- SetFreqTX(frequency)
- SetRateRX(rate)

Commands to program a pulse sequence:

- ClearPulses()
- AddDelay(gate, duration)
- AddPulse(level, phase, duration)

Command to start pulse sequence and receive data:

- RecieveData(size)

Various commands to control output RF signal level, GPIO pins and an external DAC:

- SetLevelTX(level)
- SetPin(pin)
- ClearPin(pin)
- SetDAC(data)

The source code of the .NET library can be found in [projects/pulsed_nmr/client/PulsedNMR.cs]($source$/projects/pulsed_nmr/client/PulsedNMR.cs).

## Getting started with GNU/Linux

- Download [SD card image zip file]($release_image$) (more details about the SD card image can be found at [this link](/alpine/)).
- Copy the contents of the SD card image zip file to a micro SD card.
- Optionally, to start the application automatically at boot time, copy its `start.sh` file from `apps/pulsed_nmr` to the topmost directory on the SD card.
- Install the micro SD card in the Red Pitaya board and connect the power.
- Install required Python libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-matplotlib python3-pyqt6
```

- Clone the source code repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes
```

- Run the control program:

```bash
cd red-pitaya-notes/projects/pulsed_nmr/client
python3 pulsed_nmr.py
```
