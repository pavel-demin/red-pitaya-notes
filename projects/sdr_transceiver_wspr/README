Configuring WSPR receiver

By default, the uploads to wsprnet.org are disabled and all the decoded data are
accumulated in /dev/shm/ALL_WSPR.TXT.

To enable uploads, the CALL and GRID variables should be specified in
decode-wspr.sh. These variables should be set to the call sign of the receiving
station and its 6-character Maidenhead grid locator.

The frequency correction ppm value can be adjusted by editing the corr parameter
in write-c2-files.cfg.

The bands list in write-c2-files.cfg contains all the WSPR frequencies. They
can be enabled or disabled by uncommenting or by commenting the corresponding
lines.
