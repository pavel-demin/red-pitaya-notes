Hardware
-----

The basic blocks of the system are shown on the following diagram:

The [projects/vna_122_88](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/vna_122_88) directory contains one Tcl file [block_design.tcl](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/vna_122_88/block_design.tcl) that instantiates, configures and interconnects all the needed IP cores.

Software
-----

The [projects/vna_122_88/server](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/vna_122_88/server) directory contains the source code of the TCP server ([vna.c](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/vna_122_88/server/vna.c)) that receives control commands and transmits the data to the control program running on a remote PC.

The [projects/vna/client](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/vna/client) directory contains the source code of the control program ([vna.py](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/vna/client/vna.py)).

Getting started with MS Windows
-----

 - Download [SD card image zip file]({{ site.release-image }}) (more details about the SD card image can be found at [this link]({{ "/alpine/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})).
 - Copy the contents of the SD card image zip file to a micro SD card.
 - Optionally, to start the application automatically at boot time, copy its `start.sh` file from `apps/vna_122_88` to the topmost directory on the SD card.
 - Install the micro SD card in the STEMlab SDR board and connect the power.
 - Download and unpack the [control program](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/releases/download/20220322/vna-win32-20220322.zip).
 - Run the `vna.exe` program.
 - Type in the IP address of the STEMlab SDR board and press Connect button.
 - Perform calibration and measurements.
